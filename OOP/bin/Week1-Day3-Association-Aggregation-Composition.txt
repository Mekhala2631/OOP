	-   Association :
	
		-	Association is a connection or relationship between two separate classes.
		-	Association depicts HAS-A relationship between the classes
		
			Ex: Employee HAS-A Address
			      Person HAS-A Passport 
				  
==================	
	-   Aggregation :
	
		- 	Special kind of Association. 
		-	If an object is destroyed, it will not affect the other object. 
		-	Other object can work independently.
		
			Ex: 	An Employee in a company belongs to a particular Department. 
					If the Employee object gets destroyed still the Department can work independently.
					
					Bank has Customers
					If a Customer closes his account, still the Bank object can work independently.
			
=================				
	-	Composition :
		-	Composition is another form of Aggregation which is considered as the restricted form of Association.
		-	Entities are completely dependent on each other, unlike the aggregation.
		
			Ex: 
			- 	A House has Rooms
			- 	A single house can have multiple rooms but a single room can not have multiple houses. 
			-	And, if we delete the house, the rooms will automatically be deleted.
		  ---
			- A Car has Engine
			- Without Engine a Car cannot exist
